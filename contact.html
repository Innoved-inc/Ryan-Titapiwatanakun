                <p>I chose to make this website about Iron Man because he has always been my favorite character in the MCU.
                    I like his personality of sharing his money and using it for good, and his intelligence. My favorite
                    part about making this website was when I got to create my home page and add a banner. To me, that is
                    the best looking part of this whole website. The biggest challenge I faced was making all of the pictures
                    show up on the screen. I had to remember the basics of coding when I used an image. If I were to make
                    another webiste, I would most likely make it about the steps to code a website or the facts and history
                    on an instrument. Personally, I enjoy making websites because it lets me practicing typing on the keyboard
                    more. I realized that I am now typing faster now than when I first started. All in all, this is why I
                    chose Iron Man as my topic and where I am in website experience. </p>
