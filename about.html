            <h1 class="center"> More about Iron Man</h1>
            <p class="center">Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character
                was created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don
                Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March
                1963). A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark
                suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon
                of mass destruction, he instead creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later,
                Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company,
                Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at
                first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually declared that he was, in fact, Iron Man in a public
                announcement. There are three Iron Man movies that have been released since 2008. Iron Man is also included
                in the Avengers movies since 2012. </p>
